# The ELK programming language
WIP, not ready for use yet

Inspired by Gleam, Rust, Elm, Haskell and Scala.

## TODO
- Expressions evaluate to a type
- Type-bound functions
- Pattern matching
- Lists and tuples
- Standard library
- Type inference

## To think about
- Functions without arguments?
- Functions without return type?
- Function calling syntax
